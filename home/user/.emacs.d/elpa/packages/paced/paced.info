Introduction
************

Paced (Predictive Abbreviation Completion and Expansion using
Dictionaries) scans a group of files (determined by “population
commands”) to construct a usage table (dictionary).  Words (or symbols)
are sorted by their usage, and may be later presented to the user for
completion.  A dictionary can then be saved to a file, to be loaded
later.

   Population commands determine how a dictionary should be filled with
words or symbols.  A dictionary may have multiple population commands,
and population may be performed asynchronously.  Once population is
finished, the contents are sorted, with more commonly used words at the
front.  Dictionaries may be edited through EIEIO’s customize-object
interface.

   Completion is done through ‘completion-at-point’.  The dictionary to
use for completion can be customized.

File: paced.info,  Node: Similar Packages,  Next: Installation,  Up: Introduction

Similar Packages
================

There are a few Emacs packages that have similar goals to paced, and
provided some of the inspiration and motivation behind it.

* Menu:

* pabbrev::
* predictive::


File: paced.info,  Node: pabbrev,  Next: predictive,  Up: Similar Packages

pabbrev
-------

The pabbrev (https://github.com/phillord/pabbrev) package by Phillip
Lord automatically scans text of the current buffer while Emacs is idle
and presents the user with the most common completions.

   One of the major downsides to pabbrev is that the data it collects
doesn’t persist between Emacs sessions.  For a few files that are always
open, such as org agenda files, pabbrev works great.  If you want to
train it from a few files that aren’t always open, you’ll have to open
each file and retrain pabbrev from that file.  And you’ll have to do
this every time you restart Emacs.

   It keeps up-to-date usage and prefix hashes of all buffers of the
same mode, and scanning, or “scavenging”, blends seamlessly into the
background.  Completion is just a hash table lookup, so it can handle
completion in microseconds.  There’s also no setup required; it will
start working right away.  The downside to this is that dictionaries
aren’t flexible; each dictionary corresponds to a major mode, and
there’s no way to change that.


File: paced.info,  Node: predictive,  Prev: pabbrev,  Up: Similar Packages

predictive
----------

The predictive (https://www.dr-qubit.org/predictive.html) package by
Toby Cubitt scans text of the current buffer on user command.  The usage
data is stored in a dictionary, which can then be saved to a disk.
Extensions are provided to ‘completion-at-point’, or predictive’s
built-in frontend can be used.  It has a safety precaution where it only
adds existing words to a dictionary, unless the user allows this.  This
is to avoid adding typos to a dictionary.

   Completion was also done intelligently, grouping commonly used words
together and optionally suggesting shorter words before longer words.

   While the frontend and backend are separate, the frontend is required
to populate a dictionary.  There is no way to exclude part of the
buffer’s text from dictionary population.  The safety precaution
predictive has where it only adds a word to a dictionary if it already
exists was tedious, since I didn’t need it to do that.

Installation
============

*Requirements*

Emacs   25.1
async   1.9.1

   Right now, the only way to install paced is from source.

   From Source:

     bzr branch https://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/r/paced-el paced

   After that, add the following to your init file (typically .emacs):

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/full/path/to/paced/")
     (require 'paced)


File: paced.info,  Node: Basic Setup,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

Basic Setup
===========

Paced needn’t have a lot of setup to run.  In fact, the simplest setup
is as follows:

  1. Create a new dictionary, “Default” (See *note Creating a
     Dictionary::)
  2. Set paced-global-dict-enable-alist to ‘((t . "Default"))’ (See
     *note Selective Dictionaries::)
  3. Run ‘M-x global-paced-mode’
  4. To add a file to the dictionary, use ‘M-x
     paced-add-buffer-file-to-dictionary’

   This will create a default dictionary and populate it from buffers
you specify.

Creating a Dictionary
=====================

Now that you’ve got paced installed, it’s time to create a new
dictionary.

     M-x paced-create-new-dictionary RET DICTIONARY_NAME RET DICTIONARY_FILE RET

   Let’s explain those two arguments:

   First, you’ve got DICTIONARY_NAME. This is a string that will be used
to reference the new dictionary.  We recommend something short, like
’new-dict’, ’my-dict’, ’writing’, etc.

   Next is the file where the dictionary will be stored.  This is
typically stored in ‘paced-dictionary-directory’, from which all
dictionaries will be loaded with ‘paced-load-all-dictionaries’ (more on
that later).  For now, it’s important to know that
‘paced-load-all-dictionaries’ is the easiest way to load dictionaries
when paced is loaded.

   After you’ve run the above command, you will be taken to the
customization buffer.  This is where you can set population commands.


File: paced.info,  Node: Editing a Dictionary,  Next: Selective Dictionaries,  Prev: Creating a Dictionary,  Up: Dictionaries

Editing a Dictionary
====================

In order to edit a dictionary, paced provides
‘paced-edit-named-dictionary’ and ‘paced-edit-current-dictionary’.

   The edit buffer provides the options to change the population
commands, case handling, dictionary storage name, and sort method.  Each
of these is documented in the edit buffer.


File: paced.info,  Node: Selective Dictionaries,  Next: Dictionary Files,  Prev: Editing a Dictionary,  Up: Dictionaries

Selective Dictionaries
======================

Paced provides a mechanism called the “enable list”, that allows a user
to enable certain dictionaries for completion given certain conditions.

   There are two enable lists: a global and local one.  They both work
the same, with the local one taking precedence.  Each entry in the list
has a condition and a key.

   The conditions are one of the following:

   • A mode name, such as ‘org-mode’ or ‘text-mode’, indicating that the
     named dictionary should be active in any mode derived from that
     mode.

   • A symbol, in which case the named dictionary is active whenever the
     value of that symbol is non-nil.  This includes the symbol ‘t’.

   • A function symbol, in which case the function is called with no
     arguments to determine if the given dictionary should be enabled.
     If the function returns non-nil the dictionary is enabled.

   • A lambda function, in which case it is called with no arguments,
     and if it returns non-nil, the dictionary is enabled.

   • The form (or CONDITION1 CONDITION2 ...), which enables the given
     dictionary if any of the conditions are met.

   • The form (and CONDITION1 CONDITION2 ...), which enables the given
     dictionary if all of the conditions are met.

   Remember that paced-mode must be active for completion to occur.
Neither list will activate it, just determine which dictionary is
active.

   The key is the dictionary name you set during dictionary creation.


File: paced.info,  Node: Dictionary Files,  Prev: Selective Dictionaries,  Up: Dictionaries

Dictionary Files
================

Paced provides ‘paced-load-all-dictionaries’ to load all dictionaries in
‘paced-dictionary-directory’.  Paced determines which dictionaries to
load based on two variables:
‘paced-dictionary-directory-whitelist-regexp’ and
‘paced-dictionary-directory-blacklist-regexp’.  Paced can also be told
to search recursively by setting
‘paced-load-all-dictionaries-recursively’ to t.  All four of these
variables may be set using Emacs’s customization interface.

   An individual dictionary file may also be loaded:

     M-x paced-load-dictionary-from-file RET /path/to/file RET

   Once a file has been modified, it may then be saved:

     M-x paced-save-named-dictionary RET dictionary name RET

   Or, all dictionaries may be saved:

     M-x paced-save-all-dictionaries RET

   Dictionaries may also be automatically saved whenever changed by
setting ‘paced-repopulate-saves-dictionary’ to t.  Population is covered
in the next section.

Population Commands
*******************

Part of the beauty of paced is the ease of reconstructing a dictionary.
When you’ve got a bunch of files from which you want to populate your
dictionary, it’d be a pain to go to each of them and say “populate from
this one, next, populate from this one, next”.

   Instead, paced provides population commands.  Each dictionary has one
or more population commands it uses to recreate its contents, run in
order during population.

   In order to trigger population, run the following:

     M-x paced-repopulate-named-dictionary RET DICTIONARY-NAME RET

* Properties::                   Tweaking the defaults
* Custom Commands::              Defining new population commands
* Asynchronous Population::      Populating without blocking


File: paced.info,  Node: Built-in Commands,  Next: Properties,  Up: Population Commands

Built-in Commands
=================

There are five built-in population commands:

file
     Populates a dictionary from all words in a given file
buffer
     Populates a dictionary from all words in a given buffer, which must
     exist during population
file-function
     Like the file command, but allows a custom setup function.  This
     function is called with no arguments in a temporary buffer
     containing the file’s contents, and must return non-nil if
     population may continue.
directory-regexp
     Populates from all files in a directory that match the given
     regexp.  Also optionally allows recursion.
file-list
     Populates from all files returned by a generator function.


File: paced.info,  Node: Properties,  Next: Custom Commands,  Prev: Built-in Commands,  Up: Population Commands

Properties
==========

When setting the population commands of a dictionary, one may also set
certain properties.  Each property is a variable binding, bound while
the population command runs.

   Two variables are of note here:

paced-exclude-function
     Function of no arguments that returns non-nil if the thing at point
     should be excluded from population.
paced-thing-at-point-constituent
     Symbol defining thing on which population works.  Typically set to
     either ’symbol or ’word.

   For convenience, properties that are intended for all population
commands of a given dictionary may be set in the dictionary itself.  In
the event of a conflict, population command properties take precedence
over dictionary properties.


File: paced.info,  Node: Custom Commands,  Next: Asynchronous Population,  Prev: Properties,  Up: Population Commands

Custom Commands
===============

Since the population commands all derive from paced-population-command,
it’s possible to add additional commands.

   As an example, let’s make a population command that populates a
dictionary from a file like so:

     alpha 5
     beta 7
     gamma 21
     delta 54
     epsilon 2

   We want to make a population command that takes a file like this,
with word in one column and weight in the other, and add it to a
dictionary.

   There are two ways to approach this, but we’re going to start with
the basic one.

   We need to define two functions: paced-population-command-source-list
and paced-population-command-setup-buffer.  The first returns a list of
sources from which to populate, and the second sets up a temporary
buffer based on those sources.

   For our command, we want to return the specified file, and replicate
each word by the amount given.

   Inheriting from ‘paced-file-population-command’ gives us the source
list and file slot for free.

     (defclass paced-weight-file-population-command (paced-file-population-command))

   Now, we need to set up the buffer to replicate the words.

     (cl-defmethod paced-population-command-setup-buffer ((cmd paced-weight-file-population-command) source)
       ;; Use the built-in `paced--insert-file-contents' to insert contents.
       (paced--insert-file-contents source)
       ;; Jump to the start of the buffer
       (goto-char (point-min))
       ;; Search for lines with the form WORD WEIGHT
       (while (re-search-forward (rx line-start ;; Start of line
                                     (submatch (one-or-more (not (syntax whitespace)))) ;; Our word
                                     (syntax whitespace) ;; Space between word and weight
                                     (submatch (one-or-more (any digit))) ;; Weight
                                     line-end) ;; End of line
                                 nil t)
         (let* ((word (match-string 1))
                (weight (string-to-number (match-string 2)))
                ;; Repeat WORD WEIGHT times
                (new-text (string-join (make-list weight word) " ")))
           ;; Replace the matched text with our repeated word
           (replace-match new-text))))

   That’s all there is to it.  When you go to edit a dictionary, the
“weight-file” population command will automatically be added as an
option for a population command.

   The even easier way to do this would’ve been to use
‘paced-file-function-population-command’, but it doesn’t make for a good
example in this case.


File: paced.info,  Node: Asynchronous Population,  Prev: Custom Commands,  Up: Population Commands

Asynchronous Population
=======================

A common problem is that population can take a long time.  Some of us
populate dictionaries from org agenda files, which can get pretty big.

   To solve this, paced uses the async
(https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async) package.  Setup should be
seamless; just stick whatever code you need in
‘~/.emacs.d/paced-async.el’, type M-x
paced-repopulate-named-dictionary-async, and push enter.

   A few things to note about this:

  1. Dictionaries will be automatically saved by this method after
     population
  2. Asynchronous population doesn’t change anything until after
     population is finished, so a user may continue to use their
     dictionary while population is happening.
  3. Because async runs population in a separate Emacs process, any
     custom code required for population must be in paced-async.el.
     This includes additional population command types, but doesn’t
     include the following variables:

        • load-path
        • paced-thing-at-point-constituent
        • paced-async-load-file

Example Setups
**************

* Menu:

* Org Agenda Files::
* Project Files::


File: paced.info,  Node: Org Agenda Files,  Next: Project Files,  Up: Example Setups

Org Agenda Files
================

As some of us record everything about our lives in our agenda files, it
might be helpful to have a dictionary tuned to ourselves.

   We use a file-list command that returns the agenda files, and an
exclude command to block out all of Org’s extra features such as source
code and drawers.

   The generator for file-list is easy:

     (lambda nil org-agenda-files)

   Done.

   Now, the exclude command, which sits inside the properties option:

     (defun org-paced-exclude ()
       (or
        ;; Drawers
        (org-between-regexps-p org-drawer-regexp ":END:") ;; Doesn't catch END
        (org-in-regexp ":END:") ;; but this does

        (org-at-comment-p) ;; comments
        (org-in-regexp org-any-link-re) ;; links
        (org-in-block-p '("src" "quote" "verse")) ;; blocks
        (org-at-planning-p) ;; deadline, etc.
        (org-at-table-p) ;; tables
        ))

   As explained earlier, this can be put inside properties in the
customize buffer as such:

     Properties :
     [INS] [DEL] Variable: paced-exclude-function
     Lisp expression: 'org-paced-exclude

   And you’re done.  See how easy that was?


File: paced.info,  Node: Project Files,  Prev: Org Agenda Files,  Up: Example Setups

Project Files
=============

Now we get to the interesting one.  There are tons of ways to collect
project files in Emacs, so we’re going to stick with one for now, being
Emacs’s built-in VC package.

     (defun vc-paced-find-project-files (path-to-project-root)
       "Use VC to collect all version-controlled files."
       (let ((file-list))
         (vc-file-tree-walk path-to-project-root (lambda (f) (push f file-list)))
         file-list))

   We’d then need to use the following for our file-list generator:

     Generator : (lambda nil (vc-paced-find-project-files "/home/me/programming/paced"))

   Now, we (probably) don’t want commented code to get in our way, so
we’ll use a small function for excluding those:

     (defun paced-at-comment-p ()
       (nth 8 (syntax-ppss)))

   Use that for paced-exclude-function, and you’re done.  We can’t
necessarily recommend this for any programming language, as there are
dedicated solutions for almost everything, but it makes an excellent
fallback.

Bugs
====

There are two ways to submit bug reports:

  1. Using the bug tracker at Savannah
  2. Sending an email using ‘paced-submit-bug-report’

   When submitting a bug report, be sure to include a description of the
dictionary or population command that caused the problem, with as much
detail as possible.


File: paced.info,  Node: Development,  Next: Documentation,  Prev: Bugs,  Up: Contributing

Development
===========

If you’re new to bazaar, we recommend using Emacs’s built-in VC package.
It eases the overhead of dealing with a brand new VCS with a few
standard commands.  For more information, see the info page on it (In
Emacs, this is C-h r m Introduction to VC RET).

   To contribute with bazaar, you can do the following:

     # Hack away and make your changes
     $ bzr commit -m "Changes I've made"
     $ bzr send -o file-name.txt

   Then, use ‘paced-submit-bug-report’ and attach “file-name.txt”.  We
can then merge that into the main development branch.

   There are a few rules to follow:

   • New population commands should be named
     paced-POPULATION-COMMAND-TYPE-population-command
   • Run ’make check’ to verify that your mods don’t break anything
   • Avoid additional or altered dependencies if at all possible


File: paced.info,  Node: Documentation,  Next: Working with EDE,  Prev: Development,  Up: Contributing

Documentation
=============

Documentation is always helpful to us.  Please be sure to do the
following after making any changes:

  1. Update the info page in the repository with ‘C-c C-e i i’
  2. If you’re updating the HTML documentation, switch to a theme that
     can easily be read on a white background; we recommend the
     “adwaita” theme


File: paced.info,  Node: Working with EDE,  Prev: Documentation,  Up: Contributing

Working with EDE
================

EDE can be a little finicky at times, but we feel the benefits, namely
package dependency handling and Makefile generation, outweigh the costs.

   One of the issues that many will likely encounter is the error
“Corrupt file on disk”.  This is most often due to EDE not loading all
its subprojects as needed.  If you find yourself dealing with this error
often, place the following in your .emacs file:

     ;; Target types needed for working with paced
     (require 'ede/proj-elisp)
     (require 'ede/proj-aux)
     (require 'ede/proj-misc)

   These are the three target types that paced uses: elisp for
compilation and autoloads; aux for auxiliary files such as
documentation; and misc for tests.

   When creating a new file, EDE will ask if you want to add it to a
target.  Consult with one of the paced devs for guidance, but usually
selecting “none” and letting one of us handle it is a good way to go.
